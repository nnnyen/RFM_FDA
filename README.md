# RFM_FDA
- Customer Segmentation by using analyze RFM with K-means Clustering
- This is the group project for Fundamental data analysis subject
- Data source: AdventureWorks database
## DATA PREPARATION
- Use descriptive statistics to eliminate outliers
- Use EDA to analyze the relationship between variables of interest
- We need to import the library to be able to process data more easily
## MACHINE LEARNING METHOD
- Create DataFrame for RFM base on IQR
- Use Elbow to count the clusters of Kmeans and have double check with Silhoutte
- Use Kmeans for Customer Segmentation
## VISUALIZATION OF EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
- Customer Lifetime Value to have more insight of the clusters by group by customers and check last date of purshace
- Visualize by plots of machine learning method to analyze more information of the clusters
